This is my website recreation project with CodeNation of a personal favourite website, www.Twitch.tv.
After being apart of a previous Cohort at CodeNation before being employed as an apprentice at Orcha my tech stack has moved on Vanilla Javascript to using the Facebook React framework.

Development has slowed down on this project as it is near completion and I've moved onto bigger more functional projects.

Feel free to take a peak, tweak, and break :)
